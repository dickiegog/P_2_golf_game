## Description

Golf Game is a simple two-player golf simulation game. Players take turns to hit the golf ball towards the hole, and the player with the fewest swings wins the game. The game includes multiple holes, each with its own par score, and the player's score is calculated based on their performance relative to the par score of each hole.

## Game Rules

- The game consists of multiple holes, each with its own par score, which represents the expected number of swings to complete the hole.
- Players take turns hitting the golf ball toward the hole.
- Players can choose to manually swing or enable an "Auto" mode for the second player, simulating play against a computer.
- The player with the fewest swings wins each hole.
- After both players finish a hole, the par score of that hole is added to their overall score.
- The game ends after completing all the holes, and the player with the lowest overall score wins.
